          <h2>How It All Started</h2>

          <h2>Vinyl’s Golden Age</h2>
          <p>By the 1950s, vinyl wasn’t just a thing — it was *the* thing. LPs gave artists the power to tell full stories, and 45s were spinning in every diner and dance hall. It wasn’t just music — it was a whole vibe you could hold in your hands.</p>

          <h2>Enter: The Digital Takeover</h2>
          <p>Fast forward to the 80s, and CDs pulled up like the new kid at school. Smaller, shinier, digital — the future, apparently. Then came MP3s, then streaming, and suddenly music went from something you *kept* to something you just *clicked.*</p>

          <h2>The Vinyl Comeback</h2>
          <p>And now? People realized you can’t beat the ritual — flipping a record, hearing the crackle, feeling *something* real. Vinyl’s back, and honestly, she’s thriving.</p>
