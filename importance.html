          <h2>It’s About Feeling Something</h2>
          <p>Scrolling is cool and all, but holding a record? Reading the lyrics? Seeing the album art up close? That hits different. Physical media turns music into a full-on experience, not just background noise.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>You Actually Own It</h2>
          <p>One day you’re vibing to your favorite album on a streaming app — next day? *Gone.* Physical media says “Nope. Mine forever.” Nobody’s snatching your vinyl off your shelf.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Sound Is *Chef’s Kiss*</h2>
          <p>There’s something about vinyl that just feels warmer, richer, better. It’s like the difference between fresh-baked cookies and store-bought ones. Both are fine, but one just *hits.*</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>It’s Culture You Can Hold</h2>
          <p>Vinyl isn’t just music — it’s a snapshot of a whole moment. The cover art, the liner notes, the limited editions — it’s history you can touch. It’s nostalgia and authenticity all rolled into one.</p>
